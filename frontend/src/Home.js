          People read for various reasons. Some read to broaden their perspective of the world and learn new things, some read to learn how to articulate their thoughts, some read to get inspiration, some read to get their mind free and see faraway places through the eye of their mind, some read to relax their mind after a tiring day full of hard work, deadlines and reports, while some read just for fun.

It is our goal to provide a definitive reading experience to the members of IIT Kanpur, be it in procuring books, indexing them for easy access, making them available for reading or in letting you review them and see reviews others have made.
